0.64    2007-04-23
    - added DBD::Pg to depencies, reported by MSTEVENS as RT #26377
    - first create a dist object, add the data later in another eval. This
      way more dists should end up in the DB. (eg Lingua-DE-ASCII, which 
      includes latin1 filenames that cause problems in the (utf8) db)


0.63    2006-09-13
    - added new metrics to DB Classes (has_license, has_example,
      buildtool_not_executable, manifest_matches_dist

      
0.62    2006-07-31
    - added t/99_pod.t test (I'm not in the mood right now to write docs
      so t/99_pod_coverage.t has to wait a bit...)
    - adapted DBIx::Class calls to 0.07000
    - delete dist from DB if they are no longer on CPAN
      thanks to BDFOY and TINITA for pointing it out.
