<dt>2008-01-14: up again</dt>
<dd>After a very long downtime caused by a combination of Christmas and me
changing jobs, CPANTS will be soon back up to regular (daily) updates. I'm
currently in the middle of setting things up on a new server provided by <a
href="http://vienna.pm.org">Vienna.pm</a>. cpants.perl.org already points to
the new server.<br>
<br><br>
Thanks for your patience, and sorry for any inconveniences...
</dd>


<dt>2007-11-07: better data</dt>
<dd>
I fixed a few bugs and generated new data (which took a bit more than 6 hours). But nothing fancy...
</dd>

<dt>2007-10-30: reworked dist view</dt>
<dd>
The view for a dist is now broken up into several subpages. This makes the data more easy to read. I've also fixed some minor problems in the list of prereqs etc (links are now going to the dist each module is in).
</dd>

<dt>2007-10-29: new optional metric: <i>use_warnings</i></dt>
<dd>
I've added a new metric: <code>use_warnings</code>. This metric checks if all of your modules include a line like 'use warnings;'. As this does not work for old Perls, I've made it an optional metric (for now..). 
<br><br>
A patch submitted by Adriano Ferreira enhances MANIFEST-checking (and removes a bug caused by chdir). See RT #28982 for details.
<br><br>
Andy Armstrong suggested to also look in <code>xt/</code> for tests, because this is becoming the new place for optional author tests (like pod-coverage). Which I implemented...
<br><br>
I've also re-analysed all of CPAN. The only thing left to do now (besides adding more metrics) is to make the various graphs work again...
</dd>


<dt>2007-07-13: CPANTS up again</dt>
<dd>The server now has more memory (Thanks, Andy!), so CPANTS is back to a regular update interval of once a day. I had to revert some of the recent changes, though, so various patches sent in by Barbie and Gabor are not live at the moment.
<br>
Additionally, I'm now off for one month of trecking in Mongolia, with no net access. So if CPANTS has a problem again, I won't be able to tend to it until end of August (where I won't have much time either, thanks to <a href="http://vienna.yapceurope.org">YAPC::Europe</a>).
</dd>

<dt>2007-06-15: CPANTS down</dt>
<dd>Due to some problems that CPANTS caused on the server (taking to much
memory..) currently no new data is beeing calculated. And the data shown might
be wrong... I do hope to find some time to fix this, but it't not going to
happen today.</dd>
<dt>2007-04-23: New releases<dt>
<dd>
I've fixed lots of bugs reported via RT and email. Thanks for the hints and patches! Quality of CPANTS data should be a bit better now...
</dd>

<dt>2007-04-02: Old metrics<dt>
<dd>Now that April 1sth is over, we're back to the regular metrics...</dd>

<dt>2007-04-01: New metrics</dt>
<dd>Thanks to Catalyst & DBIx::Class I finished my <a
href="http://oe1.orf.at">$big_project</a> a bit early. I
used this time to implement a few long-pending metrics:

<ul>
<li>docs_make_sense
<li>mentions_kwalitee
<li>uses_version_control
<li>reuses_code
<li>uses_recursion
<li>correct_speling
<li>nice_code_layout
</ul>

You can find a more detailed description <a
href="/kwalitee_april_1st_2007.html">here</a><br><br>
Happy gaming!</dd>

<dt>2007-03-10: New server! SQLite Dump!</dt>
<dd>CPANTS now lives on a <b>new server provided by <a
href="http://hexten.net">hexten.net</a></b>. Thanks!!<br>
Starting tomorrow, there will again be daily updates, so you can now continue
playing the CPANTS game and raising your kwalitee (and hopefully making CPAN a
nicer place in the process...)<br><br>

Thanks to the nice <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-PgLite/">DBD::PgLite::MirrorPgToSQLite</a>
there is now a daily SQLite dump of the CPANTS database available. I hope you
won't get blind from looking at the schema...<br>
You can get the latest dump from this URL: <a
href="http://cpants.perl.org/static/sqlite/cpants_all.db.gz">http://cpants.perl.org/static/sqlite/cpants_all.db.gz</a>.<br>
Have fun playing with the data!

<dt>2006-11-04: metayml_conforms_spec_1_0 and _current</dt>
<dd>After some discussions on perl-qa I split metayml_conforms_spec into metayml_conforms_spec_1_0 and
metayml_conforms_spec_current (which is an optional metric).</dd>

<dt>2006-10-30: More Graphs & has_license changes</dt>
<dd>There are now graphs showing the kwalitee of a distribution and the
average kwalitee and number of dists of an author over time. They are located
at the bottom of the authors page and the kwalitee detail page of a dist. I
also reworked the has_license metric a bit. It has been replaced by
has_humanreadable_license, metayml_has_license and the new
metayml_conforms_spec.</dd>

<dt>2006-09-28: Cronjob</dt>
<dd>I finally managed to set up a working cronjob for CPANTS. You can expect new data each day around 02:45 EDT. Only newly uploaded dists will be checked daily. I will only do a full run (which takes some hours) if there's a change to the metrics.</dd>

<dt>2006-09-26: Revamped Website</dt>
<dd>Thanks to the incredibly helpful <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~bricas/">Brian Cassidy</a> the site is now working much better than before. He submitted several patches that cleaned up my horrible Catalyst code in Module::CPANTS::Site.</dd>

<dt>2006-09-13: has_license</dt>
<dd>A new metric, implemented by <a href="http://www.szabgab.com/">Gabor Szabo</a>, has_license checks if there is a license specified in META.yml. This metric will be soon enhances to also look in other places for a license.</dt>

<dt>2006-09-05: New metrics</dt>
<dd>During YAPC::Europe 2007 I did a small CPANTS hackathon, which resulted in several new metrics: manifest_matches_dist, buildtool_not_executable and has_exampel (which is an optional metric).<br>
I also changed the authors page a bit so: optional metrics are now clearly marked as such.
</dd>

<dt>2006-07-19</dt>
<dd>
Added News section<br>
New metric: <code>has_working_buildtool</code>. Thanks to <a href="http://steffen-mueller.net">Steffen Müller</a> for suggesting & implementing it!
Re-indexed the whole of CPAN.
</dd>
<dt>2006-07-18</dt>
<dd>
Added support for optional metrics (eg <code>is_prereq</code>).<br>
Changed Kwalitee from absolut to relative values (i.e. percentages)<br>
Changed ranking in CPANTS game to only use non-optional metrics. Now releasing a new distribution (which fulfills all core metrics) won't lower owns rank.
</dd>
