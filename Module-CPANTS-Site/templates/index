<p>CPANTS is an acronym for <b>CPAN</b> <b>T</b>esting <b>S</b>ervice. The goals of the CPANTS project are to provide some sort of quality measure (called <b>"<a href="/kwalitee.html">Kwalitee</a>"</b>) and lots of metadata for all distributions on CPAN.</p>

<p>Please take all the information presented here with a grain of salt. The methods used to test the distributions are a bit flakey, and some of the Kwalitee indicators are still subjects of discussions (which should happen on the <a href="http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-qa">perl-qa</a> list).</p>

<h3>Why don't you...</h3>

<ul>
<li>Search for <a href="/author/search">authors</a> or <a href="/dist/search">distributions</a>.
<li>Take a look at the various <a href="graphs.html">reports</a> generated at this site.
<li>Admire the top gamers of the <a href="highscores">CPANTS game</a>. 
<li>Download the latest CPANTS data as a SQLite DB from here
<blockquote><a href='/static/sqlite/cpants_all.db.gz'>cpants_all.db.gz</a>

</ul>

<h3>News</h3>

<dt>2007-06-15: CPANTS down</dt>
<dd>Due to some problems that CPANTS caused on the server (taking to much
memory..) currently no new data is beeing calculated. And the data shown might
be wrong... I do hope to find some time to fix this, but it't not going to
happen today.</dd>

<dt>2007-04-23: New releases<dt>
<dd>
I've fixed lots of bugs reported via RT and email. Thanks for the hints and patches! Quality of CPANTS data should be a bit better now...
</dd>

<dt>2007-04-02: Old metrics<dt>
<dd>Now that April 1sth is over, we're back to the regular metrics...</dd>

<dt>2007-04-01: New metrics</dt>
<dd>Thanks to Catalyst & DBIx::Class I finished my <a
href="http://oe1.orf.at">$big_project</a> a bit early. I
used this time to implement a few long-pending metrics:

<ul>
<li>docs_make_sense
<li>mentions_kwalitee
<li>uses_version_control
<li>reuses_code
<li>uses_recursion
<li>correct_speling
<li>nice_code_layout
</ul>

Happy gaming!</dd>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>CPANTS is not about running the test suite that most distributions ship with. This is done by the <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/">CPAN testers</a>.</p>

<p>One big limitation of CPANTS is that it cannot actually execute any code: The module might not run on the machine doing the testing, it might have third-party dependencies, etc. CPANTS can only gather data and Kwalitee by looking at files, source code etc. This means that there are a lot of bugs in the Kwalitee-calculating code. Don't take everything here too serious! In a future version it might be possible to collect metadata from various distributed testers who run the tests on different platforms and settings (as CPAN testers do).</p>
