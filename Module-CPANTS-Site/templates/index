<p>CPANTS is an acronym for <b>CPAN</b> <b>T</b>esting <b>S</b>ervice. The goals of the CPANTS project are to provide some sort of quality measure (called <b>"<a href="/kwalitee.html">Kwalitee</a>"</b>) and lots of metadata for all distributions on CPAN.</p>

<p>Please take all the information presented here with a grain of salt. The methods used to test the distributions are a bit flakey, and some of the Kwalitee indicators are still subjects of discussions (which should happen on the <a href="http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl-qa">perl-qa</a> list).</p>

<dt>2007-10-24: CPANTS <b>really</b> up again</dt>
<dd>
Long time since the last update, I blame YAPC::Europe & real live.<br>
<br>
Anyway, CPANTS is now running again, but still with a few hickups. I had to
move the actual analysis from this machine to a private machine at home,
because the analysis uses a lot of CPU - to much for the box provided by <a
href="http://hexten.net">hexten.net</a>.
<br><br>
I also fixed some bugs in the handling of Meta.YML, but there are still a few
problems left. So please take the CPANTS game even less serious than ever :-)
<br><br>
But now that the basic setup is working again, I'll fix those problems soon.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>CPANTS is not about running the test suite that most distributions ship with. This is done by the <a href="http://testers.cpan.org/">CPAN testers</a>.</p>

<p>One big limitation of CPANTS is that it cannot actually execute any code: The module might not run on the machine doing the testing, it might have third-party dependencies, etc. CPANTS can only gather data and Kwalitee by looking at files, source code etc. This means that there are a lot of bugs in the Kwalitee-calculating code. Don't take everything here too serious! In a future version it might be possible to collect metadata from various distributed testers who run the tests on different platforms and settings (as CPAN testers do).</p>
