      MCK::NeedsCompiler does not contain any kwalitee_indicator, but
      adds much needed metadata.
    Barbie:
    - MCA assumes Unix paths after munging with File::Spec, thus breaking 
      portability at every turn in a non-Unix-like environment
      ... bad Thomas no biscuit!
    Barbie:
    - Refined META.yml metrics using Test::YAML::Meta and brought 'current
      spec' up to date with version 1.3 :)


0.71    2007-04-23
    - moved svn repo to http://code.google.com/p/cpants/

      if $ENV{AUTHOR_TEST} is set
    - resolved RT #25198 reported by bdfoy using his patch

      might list semi-garbage (eg according to META.yml, Siesta provides
      Apache::Constants, which it does not.)
    - skip very large test-files and only check *.t files (not everything
      in t/) as suggested by CASIANO
